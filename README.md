# PHP webauthn implementation

* Live example: [https://webauthn.davidearl.uk](https://webauthn.davidearl.uk).

[webauthn](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/) allows for log in or second factor
authentication for web sites that support the protocol in browsers that also support it,
using a physical key (such as a [Yubikey 2 security
key](https://www.yubico.com/product/security-key-by-yubico/) or [Google's Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key/)
USB key), biometrics such as fingerprints and face recognition, and now even your Windows 10 login PIN.

Webauthn was [announced for Firefox
60](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/05/09/firefox-gets-down-to-business-and-its-personal/)
in May 2018 and also later added to Chrome 67 later in 2018.

Windows 10 version 1903 distributed in summer 2019 links the Windows password-less login system to webauthn,
meaning that the same methods used to log in to Windows 10 can now also be used to log in to (or as second factor
authentication for) web sites supporting webauthn. Somewhere along the line Android also added webauthn
support for fingerprint readers. Chrome and Firefox on Mac also support webauthn via MacBook built-in
fingerprint readers and also USB keys (Yubico 2/5, Titan). Sadly, iOS is lagging behind as of August 2019:
nothing on iPhone or iPad supports webauthn, to my knowledge.

The idea of the age of
password-less logins was widely broadcast in the technical press when Firefox 60 first came out. But
the reality is the whole thing is just too complicated for easy
adoption. It needs another layer to simplify it for routine use.

There are a couple examples in Javascript (see the
["coffee" example](https://webauthn.bin.coffee/)). But the whole point is that the
challenge and authentication must be done server-side. There are also now implementations 
for Go, Ruby, Python, Java and .NET at [webauthn.io](https://webauthn.io), but PHP support is very limited, hence this library.

Webauthn is fiendishly complicated, not so much in the cryptography as the
way the structures are packed and named. Unnecessarily so
([CBOR](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049)? What? Surely browsers
could have unpacked it from that even if space is at such a premium
that keys themselves require this weird binary format; and why not
produce the key in PEM format. And so on).

So I spent quite a while translating the "coffee" example into a PHP
class for Yubico 2 keys, while doing the minimum at the browser side (just unpacking
enough to put into a convenient JSON form to transport to the server),
and I thought I would share it. Several others have since helped with support for broader
application with fingerprints and Windows Hello.

## Changes 8 Dec 2022

To prevent a possible replay of a login, the user's webauthn string is
now passed by reference to prepareForLogin and authenticate, both of
which modify it. The string should now be saved with the user in your
user after these calls, as well as when registering. This saves and
then cross-checks and clears the challenge data sent to the key, so
that it cannot be re-used.

## Changes from branch 0.1.0

The original code was updated in August 2019 by a number of
contributors (thank you!) to use composer for dependencies and update
name space, class and method names into line with conventions.

As a result, if you downloaded the original code, the various names in
your code will need to be updated. Now `\Davidearl` for the namespace
(upper case D), class name and the directory where it lives is now
`WebAuthn`, and the method names are `camelCase`.

If you want the code with the original names, download branch 0.1.0. That will not be updated in future.

## Dependencies

This requires

* [PHP CBOR library](https://github.com/2tvenom/CBOREncode): can be installed using _composer install_ in the project directory
* [phpseclib](https://github.com/phpseclib/phpseclib), ditto
* A recent openssl included in PHP ([openssl_verify](http://php.net/manual/en/function.openssl-verify.php)
in particular)
* PHP 5.6.1 or later (preferably PHP 7.4 or 8.1; not tested with PHP 8.2, which has some significant changes
  to property declarations)

## Example

The example code is live at [https://webauthn.davidearl.uk](https://webauthn.davidearl.uk).

To host the example yourself,
* put the code in the document hierarchy for your server (say `https://example.com/webauthn`),
* install CBOR etc. using `composer install`
* visit _yoururl_`/example` (e.g.`https://example.com/webauthn/example`)

If you put all the directories in webauthn at your document root and
add an index.php as follows, you can run it at the top level as e.g.
`https://example.com` (use your domain name, obviously).

`        <?php chdir('example'); include_once('index.php');`
